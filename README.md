## Configuration

### KDE

#### Appearence settings

- Application Style: Breeze
- GTK Style: Graphite
- Plasma Style: Graphite
- Colors: Pineforest
- Window Decorations: Graphite
- Font: Iosevka
- Icons: Newaita
- Cursors: Future Dark
- Splash Screen: None

Most of this can be set via System Settings GUI. Tweaking was mostly making Graphite follow system colors and not its own. Window Decorations used system collors immidetely but for Plasma Style to work it was necessary to replace 'colors' with my own version that contains only one color setting (workaround to get outlines in the same color as used in windows), rest is pulled from system colors.

Newaita icons were set to use mint folders.

#### Bismuth & Kwin

Due to me using terminal Model M122 keyboard that needs a converter to work with modern PC's some shortcuts use weird key mapping. Probably best to leave this one when using my dotfiles.

### Spotify

### Discord

Nothing fancy, just colors changed for now.

It is slighly edited 'Talljoe's Fetch' from [this](https://github.com/chick2d/neofetch-themes/) repository.
